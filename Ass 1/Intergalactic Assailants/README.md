# Intergalactic_Assailants

## About
This project is a fixed shooter arcade inspired game where the player controls an avatar, moving it side to side in order to eliminate all the enemies that are descending. This GUI version of the game allows the player to move side to side through user input, either pressing 'A' to move left or 'D' to move right, trying to avoid the enemy and their projectiles. The player will be able to shoot the enemy by pressing the 'B' key in attempts to destroy them and win the game. If the player is unable to destroy all the enemies before they descend or if the player is shot by an enemy projectile and is killed, then the game will end.
